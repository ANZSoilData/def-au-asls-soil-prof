  dct:description "Plasticity is the ability to change shape and retain the new shape after the stress is removed. The degree of plasticity given below applies only to normal plasticity. The degree of plasticity is determined at the soil moisture content used for field texturing, that is, just below sticky point. The soil is rolled between the palms of the hand and, if possible, 40 mm long rolls are formed. The rolls are dangled from the thumb and forefinger. Plasticity is determined on the behaviour of rolls of varying thickness."^^xsd:string ;

  This ontology partially describes the built-in classes and

  Please note that those tables do not include the different annotations

  Also note that the descriptions provided in this ontology do not

  Furthermore, the information provided by this ontology may be
