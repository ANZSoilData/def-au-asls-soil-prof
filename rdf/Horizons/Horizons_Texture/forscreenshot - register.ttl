  dct:description "Soil texture is determined by the size distribution of mineral particles finer than 2 mm, that is, only material that will pass a 2 mm sieve should be used in determination of field texture. Organic soils are discussed on pages 122&123. In Australia, field texture classes or field texture grades (Northcote 1979) are based on field determination of texture and not on laboratory determinations of particle size, as is done in USA for example (Soil Survey Staff 1975). There is only an approximate relationship between field texture and particle size distribution (see Marshall 1947), as factors other than clay, silt and sand content influence field texture."^^xsd:string ;
