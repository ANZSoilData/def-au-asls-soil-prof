  dct:description "Drainage is a useful term to summarise local soil wetness conditions, that is, it provides a statement about soil and site drainage likely to occur in most years. It is affected by a number of attributes, both internal and external, that may act separately or together. Internal attributes include soil structure, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and water-holding capacity, while external attributes are source and quality of water, evapotranspiration, gradient and length of slope, and position in the landscape."^^xsd:string ;

  dct:description "Water is removed from the soil so slowly that the water table remains at or near the surface for most of the year. Surface flow, groundwater and subsurface flow are major sources of water, although precipitation may be important where there is a perched water table and precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth, and often occur in depressed sites. Strong gleying and accumulation of surface organic matter are usually features of most soils."^^xsd:string ;
