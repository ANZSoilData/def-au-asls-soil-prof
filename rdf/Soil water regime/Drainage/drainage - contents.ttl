  dct:description "Water is removed from the soil so slowly that the water table remains at or near the surface for most of the year. Surface flow, groundwater and subsurface flow are major sources of water, although precipitation may be important where there is a perched water table and precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth, and often occur in depressed sites. Strong gleying and accumulation of surface organic matter are usually features of most soils."^^xsd:string ;
